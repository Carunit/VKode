This is probably the last time I'm pushing 
to this repository.

VKode was my free time project that I was creating 
when I was broed. I am not going to work on VKode 
anymore as I'm workin on Lumeo, my new programming
langage.

VKode is, to be honest, really bad. I'll probably 
fuck up Lumeo as well, but hopefully I'll make it 
at least a little bit usable this time.

I'm writing this message here because no one 
actually gives a fuck. But goodbye, VKode.
